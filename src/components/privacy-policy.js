            <p>We do not usually collect sensitive data about you unless there is a clear and valid reason for doing so and data protection laws allow us to do so.</p>
            <p>Where appropriate, we will make why we are collecting this type of personal data and what it will be used for clear.</p>
        
            <h2>How and why is your personal data used?</h2>
            <h4>We may use your personal data for a number of different purposes, which may include:</h4>
                <li>providing you with the services or information you asked for;</li>

            <h2>How long is your personal data kept for?</h2>
            <p>We keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes it was collected for, The length of time we retain your personal data for is determined by operational and legal considerations. For example, we are legally required to hold some types of personal data to fulfil our statutory and regulatory obligations (e.g. health/safety and tax/accounting purposes).</p>
            <p>We review our retention periods on a regular basis.</p>
        
            <h2>Who has access to your personal data?</h2>
            <p>We will share your personal data within our group of companies where it is in our legitimate interests to so so for internal administrative and business development purposes (for example to ensure consistent delivery of services).</p>
            <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties.</p>
            <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>However, we may disclose your personal data to third parties in order to achieve the other purposes set out in this policy. These third parties may include:</p>
                <li>Third parties working on our behalf: We may pass your personal data to our third party service providers, suppliers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf (for example to send you mailings, or organisers of events to which we have invited you). However, when we use these third parties, we disclose only the personal data that is necessary to deliver the services and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your personal data secure and prevents them from using it for their own direct marketing purposes. Please be reassured that we will not release your personal data to third parties for them to use for their own direct marketing purposes, unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.</li>
                <li>We may transfer your personal data to a third party as part of a sale of some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation, or if we’re under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our employees, supporters, clients, users of the website or others. However, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</li>
        
            <h2>Lawful Processing</h2>
            <p>Data protection law requires us to rely on one or more lawful grounds to process your personal data. We consider the following grounds to be relevant:</p>
        
            <h2>Specific Consent</h2>
            <p>Where you have provided specific consent to us using your personal data in a certain way, such as to send you newsletters or email, text and/or telephone marketing.</p>
        
            <h2>Performance of a contract</h2>
            <p>Where we are entering into a contract with you or performing our obligations under it.</p>
        
            <h2>Legal obligation</h2>
            <p>Where necessary so that we can comply with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject.</p>
        
            <h2>Vital interests</h2>
            <p>Where it is necessary to protect life or health (for example in the case of medical emergency suffered by an individual at one of our events) which requires us to share your personal data with the emergency services.</p>
        
            <h2>Legitimate interests</h2>
            <p>Where it is reasonably necessary to achieve our or others’ legitimate interests (as long as what the personal data is used for is fair and does not duly impact your rights).</p>
            <p>We consider our legitimate interests to be running Somportex Travel as a profitable organisation in pursuit of our aims and ideals, and those of our clients. For example to:</p>
                <li>send email communications which we think will be of interest to you;</li>
                <li>conduct research to better understand our markets to better target our public relations work;</li>
                <li>monitor who we deal with to protect the organisation against fraud, money laundering and other risks;</li>
                <li>enhance, modify, personalise or otherwise improve our services /communications for the benefit of our clients;</li>
                <li>and understand better how people interact with our website.</li>
            <p>When we legitimately process your personal data in this way, we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. We will not use your personal data where our interests are overridden by the impact on you, for example, where use would be excessively intrusive (unless, for instance, we are otherwise required or permitted to by law).</p>
        
            <p>When we use sensitive personal data, we require an additional legal basis to do so under data protection laws, so will either do so on the basis of your explicit consent or another route available to us at law (for example, if we need to process it for employment, social security or social protection purposes, your vital interests, or, in some cases, if it is in the public interest for us to do so).</p>
        
            <h2>Your choices</h2>
            <p>You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive marketing information from us. Every marketing message we send out includes a link to opt out or includes information about how you can request we no longer include you in future messages.</p>
